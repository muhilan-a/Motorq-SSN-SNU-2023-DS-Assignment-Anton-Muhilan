# Telemetry Data and Ignition Events Dataset
This dataset contains telemetry data and ignition events collected from a fleet of vehicles. The dataset aims to provide insights into vehicle behavior,
including speed, battery level, and ignition status. It also includes artificial ignition off events for analysis purposes.


# Data Analysis Goals
Analyze vehicle speed, battery level, and ignition status trends over time.
Identify charging events and battery level behavior before and after charging.
Investigate ignition ON and OFF patterns and their correlations with other variable
